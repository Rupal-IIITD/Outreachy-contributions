# The Open Source Survey of LibreOffice

This study is done to evaluate what Open Source means to the LibreOffice users. LibreOffice, being an open source software, has it main strength lying at the doorstep of FOSS.

Its crucial to understand the psychology of people who not only build and maintain the software but also use it. Its study is important to anyone concerned about the sustainability and success of the open source and involvement of users in predicted future.

The dataset analysis attempts to inform some of the most pressing questions about open source software, the people that create it, their experience, and their relationship to the industry that depends on it.

## Why to do this?

I believe that open source code, communities, and principles create better software. As technologists and coders, we know a lot about how open source software is created but very little about the people who create and use it. Are they professional developers, students, or hobbyists? What makes them persistent in contributing to the community, what makes them going and the software flourishing? Is it just the usage of software and its popularity or is it something more? For this it is important to put some light on â€˜the attitudes, experiences, and backgrounds of those who use, build, and maintain open source software. We need a software community where anyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, can participate. 

This is the motivation behind this survey conducted by LibreOffice i.e to see how we, as a community, are doing.

## Important aspects?

For the purpose of this study, LibreOffice asked some very fundamental questions to their users, but splitted the matrix into separate questions and added short explanations since it wouldn't be surprising that audience of LibreOffice is likely not so technically-minded like GitHub developers due to obvious reasons.

- How important is User Experience for your?
Good user experience means functional requirements are covered completely, the program is easy to use, and it is a pleasure to work with it.
- How important is Replicability for you?
Anyone can read the source code, understand how a function computes, and use it for their own projects.
- How important is Transparency for you?
The project permits use, study, and modification of the source code without restriction, and as a normal user you are regularly informed about all aspects
- How important is it to have a Trusted Producer?
Trust in the producer (or rather publisher) means you know the organization and people for years and can rely on the product in the future
- How important is the availability of Technical Support for you?
Technical support in terms of the availability of wikis and forums, as well as the possibility to contact experts and even developers.
- How important is Stability for you?
Stability means the program functions properly and does not hang or crash on unexpected conditions.
- How important is Security for you?
Security is the protection from information theft or damage as well as from disruption or misdirection of services.
- How important is the Cost factor for you?
Open source software is usually free of charge but might have follow-up costs for training and administration, for instance.
- How important is Compatibility for you?
This terms means to load data processed with old software versions (backward compatibility) as well as the compatibility across different programs and platforms.
- How important is Customizability/Modifiability for you?
The term means you can adapt the program to your personal needs and preferences regarding its visual appearance as well as the workflow.

The columns of the dataset contains there questions are the column header.

### The study is done in cmparison with the open source study done by Github.

## Results

Users were asked to give rating to each of the questions from "Not at all important" to "Extremely important". Since we are mostly interested in a comparison with the other study, both are shown in the graphic, in gray for GitHub and black for LibreOffice results.
