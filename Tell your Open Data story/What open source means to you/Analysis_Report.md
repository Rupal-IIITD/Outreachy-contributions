# The Open Source Survey of LibreOffice

This study is done to evaluate what Open Source means to the LibreOffice users. LibreOffice, being an open source software, has it main strength lying at the doorstep of FOSS.

Its crucial to understand the psychology of people who not only build and maintain the software but also use it. Its study is important to anyone concerned about the sustainability and success of the open source and involvement of users in predicted future.

The dataset analysis attempts to inform some of the most pressing questions about open source software, the people that create it, their experience, and their relationship to the industry that depends on it.

## Why to do this?

I believe that open source code, communities, and principles create better software. As technologists and coders, we know a lot about how open source software is created but very little about the people who create and use it. Are they professional developers, students, or hobbyists? What makes them persistent in contributing to the community, what makes them going and the software flourishing? Is it just the usage of software and its popularity or is it something more? For this it is important to put some light on ‘the attitudes, experiences, and backgrounds of those who use, build, and maintain open source software. We need a software community where anyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, can participate. 

This is the motivation behind this survey conducted by LibreOffice i.e to see how we, as a community, are doing.

## Survey Topics

These are the broad survey topics which are focussed on while mining the data and we are more interested in these topics while digging out inferences.

- Transparency vs Privacy: Two strong values within the open source community are commitment to transparency plus privacy and security of information. And as apparent it is, there is some kind of characterstic tension between the two values, as full commitment to either one limits the extent to which the other can be achieved. 

I was referring to one [World Values Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey) by a worldwide network of social scientists who conducted representative national surveys in almost 100 countries. It aims to explore people’s values and beliefs, how they change over time and what social and political impact they have.

The WVS analyzes a variety of factors and how they change over time like: support for democracy, tolerance of foreigners and ethnic minorities, support for gender equality,impact of religion (if at all), etc.

An interesting observation I found:

Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world:

    - Additional values versus Secular-rational values and
    - Survival values versus Self-expression values.

The global cultural map (below) shows how scores of societies are located on these two dimensions. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from Traditional values to Secular-rational and moving rightward reflects the shift from Survival values to Self–expression values.

- Mentorship & contributors: In FOSS, self-learning and Autodidactism is common and the strength of it. People often learn from working with or observing others who communicate virtually only and will likely never meet face to face. Important questions that can arise are: How do beginners seek and select mentorship within the open source community? What motivates some individuals to make casual (one-off) contributions to new projects rather than finding a mentor and diving deep into a project and a community? How do people willing to mentor make that known, and how do they select mentees?

- Community safety: Online harassment and bullying is just too rampant. There have been high-profile cases that generated substantial coverage in the press.
- Consumption: Important questions that arise here can be: who are the consumers? What do they use these projects for? Why do they select open source projects instead of commercial products? To what extent are they engaged with the values of free and open source software?
- Demographics: How representative is open source of the software developer community of the world population?

## Important aspects?

For the purpose of this study, LibreOffice asked some very fundamental questions to their users, but splitted the matrix into separate questions and added short explanations since it wouldn't be surprising that audience of LibreOffice is likely not so technically-minded like GitHub developers due to obvious reasons.

- How important is User Experience for your?
Good user experience means functional requirements are covered completely, the program is easy to use, and it is a pleasure to work with it.
- How important is Replicability for you?
Anyone can read the source code, understand how a function computes, and use it for their own projects.
- How important is Transparency for you?
The project permits use, study, and modification of the source code without restriction, and as a normal user you are regularly informed about all aspects
- How important is it to have a Trusted Producer?
Trust in the producer (or rather publisher) means you know the organization and people for years and can rely on the product in the future
- How important is the availability of Technical Support for you?
Technical support in terms of the availability of wikis and forums, as well as the possibility to contact experts and even developers.
- How important is Stability for you?
Stability means the program functions properly and does not hang or crash on unexpected conditions.
- How important is Security for you?
Security is the protection from information theft or damage as well as from disruption or misdirection of services.
- How important is the Cost factor for you?
Open source software is usually free of charge but might have follow-up costs for training and administration, for instance.
- How important is Compatibility for you?
This terms means to load data processed with old software versions (backward compatibility) as well as the compatibility across different programs and platforms.
- How important is Customizability/Modifiability for you?
The term means you can adapt the program to your personal needs and preferences regarding its visual appearance as well as the workflow.

The columns of the dataset contains there questions are the column header.

### The study is done in comparison with the open source study done by Github.

## Results

Users were asked to give rating to each of the questions from "Not at all important" to "Extremely important". Since we are mostly interested in a comparison with the other study, both are shown in the graphic, in gray for GitHub and black for LibreOffice results.

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/1.PNG)

In this figure, importance of aspects (which I listed above in bullet points) is shown. Points represent the average and whiskers the confidence interval. “Less important” doesn't necessarily mean "not important". All aspects are above the average of Moderately important.

### Inference:

The results of both studies are comparable with higher appraisal of stability, UX (user experience), and compatibility where transparency, customizability, costs, and replicability are rated lower. The most striking result is that having a Trusted Producer (or publisher) is much more relevant for users of LibreOffice.

Interesting for marketing is what office tools are used regularly. This question was asked as multiple choice and figure 2 shows – on the left – how often one of the predefined answers was checked and on the right how many different tools are used in total. 
Basically the question asked was: "What other office suites do you use on a regular basis?"

#### Not surprisingly Microsoft Word and Google Docs are used most often.

Participants had the chance to freely enter text for Other tools. AbiWord, Hancom Office, Lotus Smartsuite, Mobisystems, Polaris Office, Quattro Pro, Typora, Zoho and some text editors were mentioned but also Collabora Online is seen as a separate product.

It was even more interesting to know "how often an online suite is used".

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/3.PNG)

Next interesting question is how loyal our users are and asked for how many years they have been using LibreOffice. 

The average is 9.3 with two peaks at 5 and 15 years (as shown below) possibly because people do not remember exactly when they started.

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/4.PNG)

Next question was about expertise. As self-estimation of being an expert is sometimes not easy they rather asked whether a colleague or friend would ask to solve a problem with LibreOffice. It is interesting if those participants who are more expert than others have a different view on the open source aspects. And the results make sense: the ‘advanced’ categories Transparency, Replicability, and Trusted Producer are valued significantly higher. The following results in shows data from LibreOffice only, the asterisks indicate significant differences based on MAONVA statistics.

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/5.PNG)

LibreOffice ships two default versions, fresh and stable, where the first contains all newly introduced features while stable is the long-term and feature-frozen release. Furthermore, nightly builds allow a very early look into the development.

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/6.PNG)

### Inference 

This table shows that fresh and stable are nearly at par, and knowing if users of fresh are more brave is thrilling. And while both groups do not differ on most categories, the users of Stable favor stability, which is not too much surprising, and Fresh look for improvements in the area of User Experience and design.

The **affiliation** is quite important for an open source project as it lives by to the community. Participation is not restricted to development or special knowledge. Localization, contribution to the help, doing quality checking and not least reporting bugs or enhancement requests is essential for LibreOffice.

It was asked again as multiple choice question, and the following plot shows the breakdown of single answers where on the right-hand side the number of answers is listed.

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/8.PNG)

And now the **battle between operating systems.**

![alt text](https://github.com/Rupal-IIITD/Outreachy-contributions/blob/master/Tell%20your%20Open%20Data%20story/What%20open%20source%20means%20to%20you/Plots/9.PNG)

And of course we find the preconception represented in the open source aspects. 

**Linux users value transparency and replicability much higher whereas Windows users are more interested in the costs.**

## Insights and Conclusion

For users of LibreOffice, stability, usability, and compatibility are paramount. Less relevant aspects like transparency and replicability are more appreciated by experts and developers. Quite interesting is the importance to know the publisher (trusted producer), meaning to know the organization and people for years and relying on the product in the future.

##

So, here comes the end of story. I hope you enjoyed reading it. I did too when I saw the data and conclusions published by LibreOffice and straightaway decided to summarize it here.

Thanks for reading!
