Hi there.

This is yet another daat science story of mine.

Of late, Github published its Open source survey and dataset was made publicly available.

It is studying the following topics broadly and asking relevant questions in them:

- Transparency vs Privacy
- Mentorship & contributors
- Community safety
- Consumption
- Licensing
- Demographics
- Relationship to closed source development & the workplace

I will present here the summary of their analysis report and provide the set of relevant questions that can be asked for the survey.
