# What comes to your mind while being asked "What is your gender?"

This is one of the very famous and the most historically-common demographic question. But what's more important is to understand how and why we ask the “gender” question is important for making our research scientifically relevant. By asking questions that acknowledge the complexity of gender, we can help survey-makers better understand their audiences, open the door to more complex analysis and give gender minorities the representation they have almost always been denied.

The main problem that I have observed in the way we survey the data is that: simply asking the surveyee the straight question that "Are you male or a female?" is just ins't enough. One increasingly common “solution” is making dropdown boxes marked “male,” “female” and “transgender” — but transgender is not a gender so much as it is an indication of movement between genders. Another attempt at accepting nonbinary genders has been to delineate a box for “other” – but “other” only tells you what someone is not, not what they are.

Asking it as a choice between two binary options leaves much to be desired. We should move from unquestionably asking “male or female?” to a more nuanced interaction with gender and gender identity, one that acknowledges the complexity of gender. It’s time to move past binaries, time to deconstruct exactly what we mean and want when we ask, “What is your gender?”

Hence I am going to take you through one other extremes on this spectrum — a survey with 25 gender choices — so we can ultimately identify a gender choice question that provides useful data while being respectful of respondents.

- Girl
- Boy
- Tomboy
- Female
- Male
- Young woman
- Young man
- Trans-girl – Someone who has or is currently transitioning from male to
female.
- Trans-boy – Someone who has or is currently transitioning from female to
male.
- Gender fluid – Those who have different gender identities at different
times.
- Agender – Those with no gender identity or a neutral identity.
- Androgynous – Partly male and female. Not one specific sex.
- Bi-gender – Those who experience two gender identities, either at the same
time or swapping between the two. These can be male and female or other
identities.
- Non-binary – A blanket term to describe those who do not feel exclusively
male or female.
- Demi-boy – Someone whose identity is only partly male, regardless of their
birth gender. They may or may not also identify as another gender.
- Demi-girl – Someone whose identity is only partly female, regardless of
their birth gender. They may or may not also identify as another gender.
- Genderqueer – Those who don’t go along with traditional gender
distinctions.
- Gender nonconforming – Those who do not follow conventional ideas about
how they should look or act based on their birth gender.
- Tri-gender – Shifts between three genders, which could include male,
female and genderless or another combination.
- All genders – Someone who identifies as every possible gender option.
- In the middle of boy and girl – An individual who identifies somewhere in
between male and female.
- Intersex – Someone with physical, genetic and hormonal features of a male
and female.
- _**I don't understand such jargons.**_
- Not sure
- Rather not say
- Others (please state)

#### Inclusivity is vitally important, but survey design best practices dictate that we also need to avoid fatiguing the people taking our surveys. Certainly a massive list of answer options like this one falls under the category of “highly fatiguing” questions.
